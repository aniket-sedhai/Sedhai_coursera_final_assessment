 * @brief Converts data from integer type to ascii string
 *
 * Integer-to-ASCII needs to convert data from a standard integer type into an ASCII string.
 * All operations need to be performed using pointer arithmetic, not array indexing
 * The number you wish to convert is passed in as a signed 32-bit integer.
 * You should be able to support bases 2 to 16 by specifying the integer value of the base you wish to convert to (base).
 * Copy the converted character string to the uint8_t* pointer passed in as a parameter (ptr)
 * The signed 32-bit number will have a maximum string size (Hint: Think base 2).
 * You must place a null terminator at the end of the converted c-string
 * Function should return the length of the converted data (including a negative sign). Example my_itoa(ptr, 1234, 10) should return an ASCII string length of 5 (including the null terminator).
 * This function needs to handle signed data.
 * You may not use any string functions or libraries
 *

 * @param[out] ptr - pointer to where to store the resulting string
 * @param[in] base - base of the integer provided
